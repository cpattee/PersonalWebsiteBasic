# Personal Website Basic

A basic version of my personal website built with node.js and express.

## Running Locally

Make sure you have
1. [Node.js] (http://nodejs.org/) 
2. [Grunt] (http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) and
3. [Bower] (https://github.com/bower/bower)


```sh
git clone git@github.com:heroku/node-js-sample.git # or clone your own fork
cd node-js-sample
npm install
bower install
grunt
```

Your app should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).
